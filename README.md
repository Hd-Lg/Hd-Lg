<h1> Hi I'm Hd-Lg ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

Retraining to become a React developper - after that, a full stack dev.
Maybe I'll dip my toes in Blockchain, seems very interesting and fun. And then conquer the world with my army of robots... or just be happy, sounds less stressing. :)

<h2> About Me </h2>

- Studied and obtain my master in 'Innovation and Technology's Management with a specialisation in Entrepreneurship'.

- Started some entrepreneurial projects (might as well apply what I learned) in real estate, deployment and management of VPS for blockchain projects.
